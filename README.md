# IdionativeApp

Idionative is a website and application made to help people who want to start a new languages such as: English, Spanish, German, Japanese and so forth.

This application is just a project I've programmed for 1st year of DAW, it connects to an Oracle database that I had in my local machine, but the rest of the code should work if the connection parameters are changed.
